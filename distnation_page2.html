<p>HTML forms are simple HTML controls you use to collect information from website visitors. 
They include text boxes people can type into, list boxes they can pick from, checkboxes 
they can switch on or off, and so on. There are countless ways to use HTML forms,
 and if you’ve kicked around the Web for more than a week, you’ve used them to do everything 
from getting a stock quote to signing up for an email account</p>
